    "### Aligning the Gender Distribution with EU Population Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "The original dataset contains an equal number of male and female CVs by design. While this symmetry is useful for controlled comparisons, it does not reflect the actual gender distribution in the European Union. Recent EU population statistics indicate a ratio of **104.4 women per 100 men**, meaning that women constitute approximately **4.4% more of the population than men** [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "To account for this demographic reality, we adjust the dataset to better mirror the real-world population structure. This is done **within each domain**, rather than globally, to avoid introducing domain-specific distortions. Importantly, we keep all female CVs fixed and **randomly remove male CVs** until the female-to-male ratio within each domain matches the EU statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "This procedure serves two purposes. First, it allows us to test whether observed ranking or shortlisting patterns persist when the underlying candidate pool reflects realistic population proportions rather than a perfectly balanced synthetic setup. Second, by only removing male CVs at random, we avoid injecting any additional structure or bias into the data beyond the demographic shift itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this step helps ensure that subsequent analyses are robust to reasonable changes in the base rate of gender representation and are not artifacts of an artificially balanced dataset.\n",
